% cic_duc2560_mux_fir_comp_coeff genearats CIC compensation filter coefficients
% using frequency sampling method.
%
%    cic_duc2560_mux_fir_comp_coeff(L, Fs, Fc, plot, is_fxp, B) calculates compensation
%    filter coefficients and saves the coefficients to a file.
%
%    L      - FIR filter length (= number of taps = number of coefficients)
%    Fs     - FIR filter sample rate in Hz before interpolation
%    Fc     - FIR filter cutoff frequency in Hz
%    plot   - True or false to draw filter responses graphically
%    is_fxp - Indicating if the coefficients should be saved as fixed point or floating point numbers
%    B      - Number of bits to represent the coefficients if is_fxp is true
%
%    Examples:
%    cic_duc2560_mux_fir_comp_coeff(31,80e6,4e6,true,true,16);
%    cic_duc2560_mux_fir_comp_coeff(31,80e6,4e6,true,false)

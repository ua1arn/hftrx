% Altera NCO version 13.1
% file : nco18_v13_tb.m
%
% Description : The following Matlab testbench excercises the NCO model nco18_v13_model.m
% generated by Altera's NCO Megacore and outputs the sine and cosine waveforms
% to the variables sin_out and cos_out respectively
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Parameter description
% N : the length of input and output arrays
% fs : the desired sampling rate. For Multi-channel NCO's the channelized sample rate is fs/M 
%      ehre M is the number of channels
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
N=2048*1;
fs = 1.2288E8;
% Input arrays

% phi_inc_i : input phase increment : Length N (required)

% freq_mod_i : frequency modulation input : Length N (optional)
freq_mod_i = zeros(1,N);
% phase_mod_i : phase modulation input : Length N (optional)
